This plugin includes methods for getting all the information required for calculating the player's max hit in their 
current gear, with their current (boosted) stats, and current active prayers. The equipped weapon dictates which 
style of combat (melee, ranged, or magic) will be calculated. For magic, the users currently selected combat spell will
be used. If the equipped weapon has a special attack with a damage bonus, the special attack max hit will also be shown.
If the user is using a Salve Amulet, the first attack on an undead enemy will update the max hit. The same applies to
magic for monsters with elemental weaknesses.

Please validate against the [OSRS DPS Calculator](https://tools.runescape.wiki/osrs-dps/) and create an issue using the
